TAFE's OS - Open Source and Test Applications Assessment 2

This is the second Assessment of the OS - Open Source and Test Applications subject and I worked on a Car Rental System project. The project’s aim is to store the fleet details and all rent information on the fleet. The system will record:
 
•	Car model;
•	Car Manufacturer;
•	Manufacture Year;
•	Total KM travelled;
•	Total Services;
•	Total fuel expense;
•	Number of days that the car has been rented;
•	Number of times that the car has been rented (Journeys).
